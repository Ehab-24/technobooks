  <p>
    Business is not a race, but indeed a journey. Be honest, work hard and
    expect customers to be discerning in their choice of partner. Let our
    handshake be worth more than words on a piece of paper. Do not engage in
    marketing hype or follow the crowd. Be bold. Be self-confident. Value
    experience and steady sure-footed evolution. Always offer the best advice,
    regardless of the sales outcome. Protect our customers from risk and never
    walk away from a problem. Be accountable. Believe in the sleeping giant, the
    lesser known brand, and let our record and our customers speak for us.
